   on the road at all - it never scrolled, so it could not be somewhere the

/* ---------------- the launch ---------------------------------------
   Hold the brake - swipe down and keep your finger there, or hold the down
   key - and the car sheds speed. AIR_BRAKE is the first phase: hold that long
   and you are stopped dead with the meter at nothing. Let go any time after
   the notch and the car goes up.

   Keep holding and the second phase starts. The car is already stopped, so
   there is no speed left to give: what you are spending now is time, straight
   up, while the whole field drives past you. AIR_WIND is how long that lasts
   and it is worth a great deal more than the braking was - a dead stop is
   AIR_STOP_POW of the way to full, and the wind-up is the rest.

   The meter is the speed you have left, one for one: it empties exactly as the
   car stops, so there is never a moment where the bar says one thing and the
   road says another. The wind-up then fills the same track back up in white,
   because it is the same bar answering the same question - how much launch
   have I got - just in the other direction.

   What it costs. Braking is roughly free: a light launch comes out a couple of
   metres down on driving straight through, so it is an escape, not a shortcut.
   Winding up is anything but. Every second stopped is thirty-odd metres handed
   to five cars that are not stopped, and it is thirty-odd metres of sitting
   still in traffic where anything can barge, pin or order you and take the
   whole charge with it. A full wind therefore has to pay properly or nobody
   would ever risk one - so it does, and the curve from one end to the other is
